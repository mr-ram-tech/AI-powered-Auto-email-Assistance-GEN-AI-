Just hacked my Flutter app into becoming my own AI-powered inbox assistant 💌🤖

Here’s what it can do (all with simple chat commands):
📩 Show unread emails instantly
✍️ Draft & send replies (polite, professional, or however I want — powered by Gen AI)
✅ Mark emails as read without touching Gmail

The magic stack? ✨
Flutter ↔ n8n ↔ Gmail API ↔ OpenAI — all stitched together in one smooth flow.
